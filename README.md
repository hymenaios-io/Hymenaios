Hymenaios will query websites at a user defined interval for new software releases and then trigger Gotify/Slack notification(s) and/or WebHook(s) when one has been found.
For example, you could set it to monitor the Hymenaios repo ([hymenaios-io/hymenaios](https://github.com/hymenaios-io/hymenaios)). This will query the [GitHub API](https://api.github.com/repos/hymenaios-io/hymenaios/releases) and track the "tag_name" variable. When this variable changes from what it was on a previous query, a GitHub-style WebHook could be sent that triggers  something (like AWX) to update Hymenaios on your server.

## Building from source

#### Prereqs

The backend of Hymenaios is built with [Go](https://go.dev/) and the frontend with [React](https://reactjs.org/). The React frontend is built and then [embedded](https://pkg.go.dev/embed) into the Go binary so that those web files can be served.
- [Go 1.18+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [NodeJS 16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

#### Go changes

To see the changes you've made by modifying any of the `.go` files, you must recompile Hymenaios. You could recompile the whole app with a `make build`, but this will also recompile the React components. To save time (and CPU power), you can use the existing React static and recompile just the Go part by running `make go-build`. (Running this in the root dir will produce the `hymenaios` binary)

#### React changes

To see the changes after modifying anything in `web/ui/react-app`, you must recompile both the Go backend as well as the React frontend. This can be done by running `make build`. (Running this in the root dir will produce the `hymenaios` binary)

## Getting started

To get started with Hymenaios, simply download the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/hymenaios-io/Hymenaios/releases), and setup the config for that binary.

For further help, check out the [Getting Started](https://hymenaios.io/docs/getting-started/) page on our website.

#### Config formatting

The config can be broken down into 6 key areas. ([Further help](https://hymenaios.io/docs/config/))
- [defaults](https://hymenaios.io/docs/config/defaults/) - This is broken down into areas with defaults for [services](https://hymenaios.io/docs/config/defaults/#service-portion), [gotifies](https://hymenaios.io/docs/config/defaults/#gotify-portion), [slacks](https://hymenaios.io/docs/config/defaults/#slack-portion) and [webhooks](https://hymenaios.io/docs/config/defaults/#webhook-portion).
- [settings](https://hymenaios.io/docs/config/settings/) - Settings for the Hymenaios server.
- [service](https://hymenaios.io/docs/config/service/) - A dictionary mapping of all the services to monitor as well as what to notify when a new release is found.
- [gotify](https://hymenaios.io/docs/config/gotify/) - A dictionary mapping of targets for Gotify messages.
- [slack](https://hymenaios.io/docs/config/slack/) - A dictionary mapping of targets for Slack messages.
- [webhook](https://hymenaios.io/docs/config/webhook/) - A dictionary mapping of targets for WebHooks.
